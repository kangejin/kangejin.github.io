    <p class="card-text">Hey Ejin,

Happy 19th Birthday! Kinda sucks you’re stuck in field camp for this one but I hope you managed to pick up some sexy life skills from it. Thanks for always sticking by my side for our many years in NCC, school life and our gym brigade. We’ve been through some truly special events from Eugene to night games to NCC Camps and to operation Lionheart, what can i say. Eugene. 

It has been an amazing journey growing and developing together with you and I have truly learnt much from you. Your tenacity and team spirit has always been something I look up to and admire. I hope to be able to do the same one day for myself haha. You’ve stuck strong to your own personal values and are passionate (#ejincryforSSC) in what you put your mind to achieving(#endedupgoingtoLCanw). Keep putting your best foot forward and continue to embrace the opportunities ahead of you. Even though the current OCS training is legitimately tough as hell and will push you to your limits, stay strong, keep your mindset optimistic and never give up because we all know you can push through it. More importantly, stay safe bro and make sure safety is your number one priority regardless of the situation. 

Have a wonderful celebration with your family and get a great rest man. Happy 19th and looking forward to meeting up with you once we are actually allowed to haha. Throwback to the good old days where we gymmed at Yishun and just sat down drinking protein after it haha. Remember, chest arms and **** the rest.
